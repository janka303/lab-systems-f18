		<p class="intro">The research presented here shows a deeper dive into Japanese culture and its ties with nature. Research presented has been completed by myself and Forrest. A mutual interest in history led us through multiple paths from mythology and natural disasters, to narrowing the topic down to symbolism in one culture. We found the ties between nature fascinating, especially when compared with contemporary design. It presents an interesting topic and ideal worth exploring.</p>

		<h3>Initial Research<h3>

			<h4 class = "scope">Concept Mapping</h4>

			<p class="scope">The concept map was meant to conceive our idea and create a topic that was interesting to research as well as narrow enough that it would not overwhelm us. The point was to start with a broad topic of mutual interest, such as history, and branch out from that.</p>

		<h3>Topic Scoping</h3>

			<p class="scope"><em>Super Broad - </em>Human's historic relationship to natural disasters</p>
			<p class="scope"><em>Very Broad - </em>Japanese design and the natural environment</p>
			<p class="scope"><em>Broad - </em>How Japanese architecture evoke's and responds to nature.</p>
			<p class="scope"><em>Ideal - </em>Wood as a significant symbol in Japanese Architecture representing a broader Japanese connecion to nature.</p>
			<p class="scope"><em>Narrow - </em>The use of chibori wood-joining techniques as a symbol of the Japanese interest in representing trees in traditional architecture.</p>

		<h3>Topic Selection</h3>
			<div class = "topic">
			<p>I am studying the <strong><em>use of wood in Japanese architecture</em></strong> because I want to find out <strong><em>how cultures use materials to design for an impermanent environment</em></strong> to support making <strong><em>objects that can endure and adapt to changing environmental and social conditions.</em></strong></p>

      		<p>The following source is a report given by the Agency of Cultural Affairs in Japan that outlines many characteristics in Japanese, such as post-and-beam construction, materials, roofing, and craft. There is a discussion on how these aspects of Japanese architecture take into account the natural resources surrounding them, as well as the events and patterns of nature, such as earthquakes, decay, and the movement of people.</p>

      		<p>An insightful report that analyses and compares Japanese traditional architecture with Western thought. The paper assesses a number of contemporary Japanese architects and works, and focuses on the idea that the Japanese home looks to embody nature, rather than observe it (like many homes in the West.) By structuring an argument around the prevalence of modernism and the ‘box’ throughout the world Matthew Kubota studies what traits allowed Japanese architecture and construction to stand the test of time.</p>
