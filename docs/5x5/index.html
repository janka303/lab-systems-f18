			<h1>One a Day</h1>
			<p class="exp">Weather influences us everywhere we go. It impacts our moods, what we do that day, how we act. For this project, it also influenced what I did. Through five days, I was to observe the weather and then based off of what the weather was, I was to decide the medium. For example, if it rained that day, I would use medium using water. Instead of this being a project about weather, I wanted to explore things that I have not done in a while or have been wanting to do for a while. Personally, I feel like it is important to explore different things, however usually most people don't because of time constraints. This project allowed me to explore.<br><br><em>*While I say that I did this for five days, I only included four sketches. I felt like while one of the sketches I did was something I really wanted to do, it did not really fit with the rest, in terms of color, theme and the general aesthetic. I thought it would be better to exclude the last sketch.* </em></p>

				On the first day, the temperature was reaching around 40. When it is too warm, I feel light headed, tired, heavy. On this particular day, the heat seemed deadly, almost as if it was completely sucking any water out of me. This sculpture of a tree made me think of the desert, with nothing in site, a plane and vast scape. I thought about the copper wire, thinking about how it imitated the color of a dead tree and how it also portrayed and relayed the idea of the heat. I wanted the sculpture to be as expressive as possible to how I felt.</p>

				<p class = "p2">On the second day, it rained. I felt much better, and slightly more inspired. I also lost my ubrella, so I was getting soaked. While the rain streamed down my face, I started thinking about liquid and its properties. The idea of liquidity of an item is interesting. Often times, we experience something on something solid, whether it be a painting, an installation, a video. Through this, I was able to experience a reaction of paint with water and how it behaves. I was always fascinated about how a colored liquid behaves when it enters another liquid. While I did not receive the effect I was hoping for, I was still interested in the interaction of acrylic paint with water. The video allowed me to present it in different angles as well as play into a narrative with the music and shots I used.</p>

				<p class = "p2">On the third day, it was sunny, with a slight bit of rain. On the previous day, I used a piece of paper to help out with the cleaning during the experiment with liquidity. I looked at the colors, and thought to myself "What if I explored colors without a clear intent to what I am doing?" There are times when you do not know what to paint but you want to place a paintbrush on the paper. This sketch is a pure let out of emotions and experimenting with new strokes, colors and techniques. Throughout the whole processs, I did not clean my brush nor did I use water or a different palette. I thought it would be interesting to take the colors I observed throughout the day based on the weather and see what would happen when putting them all on one piece of paper.</p>

				<p class="p3">On the fifth day (the fourth has been skipped) it was quite sunny and once again pretty unbearable. I decided to stay inside on that day, opting to do something in the comfort of AC. I thought about always wanting to do something with clothing design, so I decided to give it a shot. Personally, the designs from my culture are important to me. I think that people do not recognize them enough and do not see the potential they have. Polish traditional clothing has incredible design. While usually used for traditional handcrafts and seen as something folky, I believe it can become rebranded and reborn in modern fashion. Not only will it create a new style, but also bring back typically Polish design.</p>
