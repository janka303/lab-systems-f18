			When I think about what surrounds me, the first thing that impacts me is the temperature. This in turn changes how I feel, how I perceive interactions on the given day. If it is cold, I feel gloomy, sad, afraid of getting sick. On the other hand, when it is too warm, I feel light headed, tired, heavy. Weather plays an important role in our day to day interactions. On this particular day, the heat seemed deadly, almost as if it was completely sucking any water out of me. This sculpture of a tree made me think of the desert, with nothing in site, a plane and vast scape. </p>

			<p class = "p2">The idea of liquidity of an item is interesting. Often times, we experience something on something solid, whether it be a painting, an installation, a video. Through this, I was able to experience a reaction of paint with water and how it behaves. I was always fascinated about how a colored liquid behaves when it enters another liquid. While I did not receive the effect I was hoping for, I was still interested in the interaction of acrylic paint with water. The video allowed me to present it in different angles as well as play into a narrative with the music and shots I used.</p>

			<p class = "p2">There are times when you do not know what to paint but you want to place a paintbrush on the paper. This sketch is a pure let out of emotions and experimenting with new strokes, colors and techniques. Throughout the whole processs, I did not clean my brush nor did I use water or a different palette. I thought it would be interesting to take the colors I observed throughout the day based on the weather and see what would happen when putting them all on one piece of paper.</p>

			<p class="p3">Personally, the designs from my culture are important to me. I think that people do not recognize them enough and do not see the potential they have. Polish traditional clothing has incredible design. While usually used for traditional handcrafts and seen as something folky, I believe it can become rebranded and reborn in modern fashion. Not only will it create a new style, but also bring back typically Polish design.</p>
