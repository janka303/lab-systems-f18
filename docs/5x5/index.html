			Now think - how can you leverage one or all of those unique properties you’ve defined from week 2 into a new and interesting way without changing the core business. How can you do something as a brand concept that is different from your competition. 

			For example, Super 8 Hotels cannot be rebranded into a traveling circus. BUT if your research shows that Super 8 Hotels has its roots in the circus, you could propose rebranding the hotel chain to be all about American vaudeville and circus acts. How would that influence the design of the brand identity? (Please note - it has not been shown that Super 8 is a circus brand - this was a hypothetical example – do your own research).</p>
